## Project Description:
# This project explores how brain signals (EEG) can be translated into natural text using state-of-the-art large language models. The baseline is the Thought2Text framework, which combines EEG encoders, multimodal alignment, and LLM fine-tuning. In this project, weâ€™ll experiment with the DeepSeek-7B model instead of the original Mistral-7B to see how model choice impacts accuracy and descriptiveness.
